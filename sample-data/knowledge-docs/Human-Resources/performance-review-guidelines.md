## Rating Distribution Guidelines

### Forced Ranking Philosophy

Nobler Works uses guided distribution, not strict forced ranking:
- Encourages differentiation
- Prevents grade inflation
- Ensures fairness across teams
- Maintains high performance bar

### Target Distribution

| Rating | Target % | Acceptable Range |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| 5 - Exceptional | 5% | 3-7% |
| 4 - Exceeds | 15% | 10-20% |
| 3 - Meets | 70% | 65-75% |
| 2 - Needs Improvement | 8% | 5-10% |
| 1 - Unsatisfactory | 2% | 0-5% |

**Notes:**
- Small teams (<10) may not fit distribution exactly
- New teams or fast-growing teams may skew higher
- Struggling teams may skew lower
- Calibration ensures consistency

## Calibration Process

### Department Calibration Meetings

**Participants:**
- Department VP (chair)
- All managers in department
- HR Business Partner
- Skip-level manager (if applicable)

**Process:**
1. **Prepare:**
   - Managers bring draft ratings
   - Summary of each employee's performance
   - Supporting evidence (OKRs, projects, feedback)

2. **Discuss:**
   - Review each employee
   - Compare similar roles/levels
   - Challenge ratings with evidence
   - Ensure consistency

3. **Adjust:**
   - Modify ratings as needed
   - Document rationale for changes
   - Get consensus from group
   - Respect distribution guidelines

4. **Finalize:**
   - VP approves final ratings
   - HR reviews for compliance
   - Compensation recommendations
   - Prepare for feedback conversations

### Cross-Department Calibration

**For roles at Director+ level:**
- Executive team calibration
- CEO reviews all VP+ ratings
- Ensures consistency across company
- Strategic talent assessment

## Self-Assessment Guidelines

### What to Include

**1. Accomplishments**
- Major projects completed
- Goals achieved
- Quantifiable results
- Impact on team/company

**Example:**
> "Led the mobile app launch, delivering iOS and Android apps on schedule. Beta program enrolled 900 users with a 4.8-star rating. This directly contributed to our Q1 product roadmap goal and positioned us to compete with larger players."

**2. Challenges & Learning**
- Obstacles faced
- How you overcame them
- What you learned
- How you'll apply learnings

**Example:**
> "Struggled with work-life balance during the mobile launch sprint. Learned the importance of delegating and setting boundaries. Now blocking 'focus time' on my calendar and empowering my team to own features end-to-end."

**3. Company Values**
- Examples of living each value
- Specific situations
- Impact on culture

**Example - Innovation First:**
> "Proposed and prototyped GraphQL API implementation, which improved response times by 40%. Shared findings with team through tech talk, inspiring others to explore new technologies."

**4. Development & Growth**
- Skills developed
- Training completed
- Certifications earned
- Career aspirations

**Example:**
> "Completed AWS Solutions Architect certification. Attended React Summit conference. Want to grow into a tech lead role in the next 12-18 months. Seeking opportunities to mentor junior engineers."

### What to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Write a novel (keep to 1-2 pages)
- Only list tasks without impact
- Be overly modest or overly boastful
- Compare yourself to others negatively
- Make excuses without learning points

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific and quantitative
- Show impact and outcomes
- Be honest about challenges
- Demonstrate growth mindset
- Align with company goals

## Manager Review Guidelines

### Writing Effective Reviews

**Structure:**
1. **Overall Performance Summary** (1 paragraph)
   - High-level assessment
   - Rating and rationale
   - Key themes

2. **Strengths** (2-3 specific examples)
   - What employee does exceptionally well
   - Demonstrated behaviors
   - Impact on team/company
   - Encourage continued excellence

3. **Areas for Development** (2-3 specific examples)
   - Skills or behaviors to improve
   - Specific situations
   - Constructive guidance
   - Support you'll provide

4. **Goals for Next Year** (3-5 goals)
   - Aligned with company OKRs
   - Stretch but achievable
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Development opportunities

5. **Career Development**
   - Growth trajectory
   - Next role/promotion timeline
   - Skills to develop
   - Opportunities to pursue

### Providing Balanced Feedback

**The Feedback Formula:**
- Situation: Describe specific context
- Behavior: What you observed
- Impact: Effect on team/project/company
- Future: How to continue or improve

**Example (Positive):**
> "During the Q4 product launch (situation), you proactively identified a critical security vulnerability (behavior). This prevented a potential breach that could have affected thousands of customers (impact). Continue to apply this security-first mindset to all your work (future)."

**Example (Developmental):**
> "In the engineering sprint retrospective (situation), you dismissed a teammate's concerns about technical debt (behavior). This made them hesitant to speak up in future meetings and we missed important feedback (impact). Practice active listening and acknowledge all perspectives, even when you disagree (future)."

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Recency Bias:**
- ❌ Only remembering last 2 months
- ✅ Review entire year's performance
- ✅ Keep ongoing notes throughout year

**Halo/Horns Effect:**
- ❌ One great (or bad) thing colors everything
- ✅ Evaluate each area independently
- ✅ Seek balanced perspective

**Similar-to-Me Bias:**
- ❌ Rating people similar to you higher
- ✅ Value diverse working styles
- ✅ Focus on results, not approach

**Leniency/Strictness Bias:**
- ❌ Rating everyone too high or too low
- ✅ Use calibration to benchmark
- ✅ Compare to performance standards, not other people

## 360-Degree Feedback

### Process

**Who Provides Feedback:**
- Manager (required)
- Peers (3-5 recommended)
- Direct reports (for managers)
- Cross-functional partners
- Customers (for customer-facing roles)

**Timing:**
- Requested: November 15
- Deadline: December 10
- Anonymous to employee
- Visible to manager and HR

### Questions Asked

**For All Employees:**
1. What are this person's key strengths?
2. What could they improve?
3. How do they demonstrate company values?
4. How effectively do they collaborate?
5. Any other feedback?

**Additional for Managers:**
6. How effective are they as a manager?
7. Do they develop their team members?
8. How do they handle difficult situations?
9. Would you want to work for them?

### Using 360 Feedback

**Managers should:**
- Review all feedback before writing review
- Look for patterns and themes
- Balance with own observations
- Use specific examples from feedback
- Protect anonymity of feedback providers

**In the review document:**
- ✅ "Peers noted your strong collaboration skills"
- ✅ "Feedback highlighted your technical expertise"
- ❌ "Sarah said you were difficult in meetings" (don't name names!)
