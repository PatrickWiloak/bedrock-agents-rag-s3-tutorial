## 1. Q1 2025 Roadmap Review

**Presenter:** Maria Gonzalez (CPO)

### Current Quarter Status (Week 3)

**Overall Progress:** 65% on track

**Completed (January):**
- ✅ Enhanced reporting dashboard (shipped Jan 15)
- ✅ API v3 improvements (shipped Jan 20)
- ✅ Mobile app beta - iOS (500 users enrolled)
- ✅ Mobile app beta - Android (400 users enrolled)

**In Progress (February):**
- 🔄 AI-powered insights (beta testing with 50 customers)
- 🔄 Advanced filtering (dev complete, QA in progress)
- 🔄 Bulk operations (85% complete)

**Upcoming (March):**
- 📅 Public API marketplace
- 📅 Workflow automation
- 📅 AI assistant (limited beta)

### Discussion

**Maria:** We're on pace for Q1. Mobile beta is going exceptionally well - 900 total users with 4.8 star rating on feedback. AI features are the biggest question mark.

**Jennifer (AI PM):** AI insights beta is with 50 customers. Early feedback is very positive - 92% say it saves them time. Two concerns: 1) Accuracy for edge cases, 2) Cost at scale.

**David (CTO):** On the cost front, we've optimized our Bedrock calls. Running about $0.15 per 1000 queries now, down from $0.40 initially. Accuracy improvements are ongoing - we're at 94% relevance score.

**Robert (SVP Eng):** Main technical risk is the AI assistant for March. That's our most ambitious feature. Recommend we make it invite-only beta rather than limited beta.

**Maria:** Agreed. Let's scope that to 20-30 design partners rather than 50-100 users.

### Action Items

- [ ] **Jennifer** - Publish AI insights beta results (Jan 31)
- [ ] **Robert** - Create AI assistant beta criteria and invite list
- [ ] **Maria** - Update board on Q1 status

   - Opportunity scoring
   - 87% accuracy rate

2. **Smart Recommendations**
   - Next best action suggestions

   - "Summarize my team's performance"

4. **AI Assistant (Pilot)**
   - Conversational interface
   - Context-aware responses
   - Task automation
   - Integration with existing features

### Technical Architecture

**Model Strategy:**
- Primary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- Fallback: GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- Embeddings: Titan Text v2 (AWS)
- Vector Store: OpenSearch Serverless

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS Bedrock for model access
- S3 for training data storage

- DynamoDB for conversation history

**Cost Model:**
- Estimated: $2.50 per user per month
- Revenue target: $15/user/month (Premium tier)
- Target margin: 80%+

### Beta Criteria

**Customer Selection:**
- Power users (top 10% engagement)
- Willing to give weekly feedback
- Diverse use cases
- Mix of company sizes

**Success Metrics:**
- 80%+ weekly active usage
- 4+ star satisfaction rating
- 30%+ time savings (self-reported)
- <5% error rate on AI responses

### Discussion

**James (Sales):** This is exactly what customers are asking for. I have 20 accounts who would be perfect beta participants. Can we expand to 50?

**Jennifer:** Let's stay at 30 for true limited beta. We can expand in April if successful. Quality over quantity.

**Lisa (CS):** What's the support model? Our CS team needs training on AI features.

**Jennifer:** We'll create a dedicated Slack channel for beta participants. Engineering will monitor closely. I'll run training sessions for CS team in February.

**Rachel (Marketing):** When can we start pre-marketing? This is going to be huge for our brand.

**Maria:** Let's wait until we have 2 weeks of beta data. Mid-March we can start content - blog posts, case studies, webinars.

**Tom (Design):** UI is looking great. One concern - the AI assistant needs clearer "thinking" indicators so users know it's processing.

**Sarah (Frontend Eng):** We can add animated "thinking" states. I'll prototype this week.

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Model Hallucination**
- Mitigation: Confidence thresholds, fact-checking layer, user feedback loop

**Risk 2: Data Privacy Concerns**
- Mitigation: Customer data stays in their instance, no training on customer data, SOC 2 compliance

**Risk 3: Performance/Latency**
- Mitigation: Caching, async processing, streaming responses

**Risk 4: Cost Overruns**
- Mitigation: Usage caps, rate limiting, cost monitoring dashboard

### Go-to-Market Plan

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Premium Tier: +$15/user/month
- Enterprise Tier: +$25/user/month (more features)
- Free trial: 30 days for existing customers

### Discussion

**Marcus:** We're in great shape for April GA. The team has done amazing work. Main decision: Do we wait for AI features or ship without them?

**Maria:** Ship without AI. We can add that in May as a mobile update. Don't delay GA for one feature.

**Robert (Eng):** Agreed. The code quality is solid. We've addressed 95% of beta feedback.

**Rachel (Marketing):** April timing is perfect. We can make mobile a big story at our user conference in May.

**James (Sales):** Mobile is a deal-closer for field sales teams. Can't wait to have this in GA.

**Kevin (Backend Eng):** One concern - sync performance on slow networks. We've improved it but still seeing issues below 1 Mbps.

**Marcus:** We've added offline queue and smart sync. Users on slow networks can still work, data syncs when connection improves.
